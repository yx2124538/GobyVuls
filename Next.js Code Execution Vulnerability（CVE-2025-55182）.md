| **Description**  |Next.js is a popular React framework widely used for building modern web applications.CVE-2025-55182 mainly affects the Server Actions feature of react-server-dom-webpack. Due to the lack of security checks when parsing client RSC-related requests, attackers can craft malicious requests to execute arbitrary code on the server and even take full control of the service. Additionally, because Next.js versions 15.x and 16.x rely on the flawed React Server DOM package when using the App Router, attackers can also inject malicious code to execute remote commands.|
| **Impact** | An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server, install a backdoor, gain server privileges, and ultimately take control of the entire web server.|
